These environments are dedicated to train efficient agents that can plan and forecast bipedal robot footsteps in order to go to a target location possibly avoiding obstacles.
They are designed to be used with Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms (as implemented in [Stable Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3)).

An example of a trained *FootstepNet* use:

- **Step 1**: A bipedal robot must score a goal while minimizing its number of steps. To do this, we arbitrarily choose $n_{alt}$ placement possibilities (here $n_{alt}=3$) which all allow scoring.
- **Step 2**: Forecasting allows choosing from the $n_{alt}$ possibilities, the one that requires the fewest steps.
- **Step 3**: The planner compute all the steps in order to go to the position chosen by the forecast.
- **Step 4**: The step sequence is executed on the real robot.

## Installation

### Footsteps Planning Environments

From source:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Train the Agent

### Using RL Baselines3 Zoo and Stable Baselines3 (SB3)

The easiest way to train the agent is to use [RL Baselines3 Zoo](https://rl-baselines3-zoo.readthedocs.io/)

The hyperparameters for the environment are defined in `hyperparameters/[algo-name].yml`.
For now, the best DRL algorithm for this environment is TD3.

You can train an agent using:

```bash
python -m rl_zoo3.train --algo td3 --env footsteps-planning-right-v0 --gym-packages gym_footsteps_planning --conf hyperparams/td3.yml
```

Where:

- `--algo td3` is the RL algorithm to use (TD3 in this case).
- `--env footsteps-planning-right-v0` is the environment to train on (see **Environments** section).
- `--gym-packages gym_footsteps_planning` is used to register the environment.
- `--conf ./hyperparams/td3.yml` is the hyperparameters file to use.

The trained agent will be stored in the `.\logs\[algo-name]\[env-name]_[exp-id]` folder from the current working directory.

### Using Stable Baselines Jax (SBX)

```bash
python train_sbx.py --algo crossq --env footsteps-planning-right-v0 --conf hyperparams/crossq.yml
```

## Enjoy a Trained Agent

### Using RL Baselines3 Zoo and Stable Baselines3 (SB3)

If a trained agent exists, you can see it in action using:

```bash
python -m rl_zoo3.enjoy --algo td3 --env footsteps-planning-right-v0 --gym-packages gym_footsteps_planning --folder logs/ --load-best \--exp-id 0
```

Where:

- `--algo td3` is the RL algorithm to use (TD3 in this case).
- `--env footsteps-planning-right-v0` is the environment to enjoy on (see **Environments** section).
- `--gym-packages gym_footsteps_planning` is used to register the environment.
- `--folder logs/` is the folder where the trained agent is stored.
- `--load-best` is used to load the best agent.
- `--exp-id 0` is the experiment ID to use (`0` meaning the latest).

### Using Stable Baselines Jax (SBX)

```bash
python enjoy_sbx.py --algo crossq --env footsteps-planning-right-v0 --gym-packages gym_footsteps_planning --folder logs/ --load-best --exp-id 0
```
## Converting model format

### PTH -> ONNX

The converter is in the PTH_Converter folder. You need to change the correct directory of your model. It must be a zip file.

### ONNX -> OpenVino

*OpenVino library is required*

```bash
python enjoy_sbx.py --algo crossq --env footsteps-planning-right-v0 --gym-packages gym_footsteps_planning --folder logs/ --load-best --exp-id 0
```

To convert the model:

```bash
mo --input_model model.onnx
```

It will create 2 files: 
- model.xml (model structure)
- model.bin (model weight)

## Environments

These environments were first design to play soccer with humanoids robots (see [RoboCup Humanoid League](https://www.robocup.org/leagues/3)). Indeed, they are made designed to place the robot in front of a ball as long as not walking on it (to shoot for example). Or even avoid an obstacle (an opponent for example) while going to a specific location.

Each environment is available in 3 different versions :

- *Right* : The target during training is always the right foot.
- *Left* : The target during training is always the left foot.
- *Any* : The target during training is either the left or the right foot (with 0.5 probability for each). It means that the trained agent can then have either foot as target.

### Action Space, Observation Space and Reward

The action and observation spaces, as well as the reward are common to all environments.

#### Observation Space

Num | Observation | Min | Max
---|---|---|---
0 | x Target support foot position [m] | $-\sqrt{4^2+4^2}$ | $\sqrt{4^2+4^2}$
1 | y Target support foot position [m] | $-\sqrt{4^2+4^2}$ | $\sqrt{4^2+4^2}$
2 | cos(theta) target support foot orientation | -1 | 1
3 | sin(theta) target support foot orientation | -1 | 1
4 | Is the current foot the target foot ? | 0 | 1

If obstacle is enabled (see below), the following observations are added:

Num | Extra observations with obstacle  | Min | Max
---|---|---|---
5 | x obstacle position in the frame of the foot [m] | $-\sqrt{4^2+4^2}$ | $\sqrt{4^2+4^2}$
6 | y obstacle position in the frame of the foot [m] | $-\sqrt{4^2+4^2}$ | $\sqrt{4^2+4^2}$
7 | Obstacle radius [m] | 0 | 0.25

**Note: The observation space positions are all defined in the frame of the current support foot. If the support foot is the left foot, transformations are used to ensure sagital symmetry.**

#### Action Space

Num | Action | Min | Max
---|---|---|---
0 | Non-support foot movement along the x axis [m] | -0.08* | 0.08
1 | Non-support foot movement along the y axis [m] | -0.04 | 0.04
2 | Non-support foot rotation [deg] | -20 | 20

*: Maximum forward step is used here to ensure a zero-centered action space. However, the backward step is clipped to 0.04 to ensure the robot stability.

#### Reward

The reward is defined as follows:

$$ R = - \delta_\text{distance error} \times 0.1 - \delta_\text{angle error} \times 0.05 - \delta_\text{collision}$$

Where:

- $\delta_\text{distance error}$ is the distance error between the target foot position and the current foot position.
- $\delta_\text{angle error}$ is the angle error between the target foot orientation and the current foot orientation.
- $\delta_\text{collision}$ is equal to **10** if the foot is colliding with the obstacle, else it is equal to **1** (penalty for each step taken) .
